#Portfolio

This project is a repository for the files used in my online portfolio. The live URL can be found <a href="https://augustgoodlund.github.io/Portfolio/">here.</a>

The portfolio was written using HTML and styled using CSS. It contains a Contact form and slideshow, both created with Javascript. The website shows an autoplaying banner video, scrolling navbar, and image containers in a slideshow.
